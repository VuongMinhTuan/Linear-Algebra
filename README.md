# Introduction
Welcome everyone to my Linear Algebra repository!! This is where I study Linear Algebra foundation concepts based on the book [Linear Algebra And Its Applications](https://www.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-Its-Applications-4th/dp/0030105676) by authors Gilbert Strang

> Click [here](https://www.amazon.com/Linear-Algebra-Its-Applications-4th/dp/0030105676) for more information about the book

If you can't purchase the book, I have included the [e-book](https://github.com/VuongMinhTuan/Linear-Algebra/blob/master/Linear_Algebra_and_Its_Application.pdf) in this repository.

If you have any questions or would like to contribute ideas, donâ€™t hesitate to reach out and discuss with [me](https://github.com/VuongMinhTuan/VuongMinhTuan).

Thank you, and happy learning!
